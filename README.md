Pre-Hackathon Assignment:

Social Media Performance Analysis

Objective:

Build a basic analytics module using Langflow and DataStax to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts.

Tools to Use:

    DataStax Astra DB for database operations.
    Langflow for workflow creation and GPT integration.

Task Details:

    Fetch Engagement Data:
        Create a small dataset simulating social media engagement (e.g., likes, shares, comments, post types).
        Store this data in DataStax Astra DB.

    Analyze Post Performance: Using Langflow, build a simple flow that
        Accepts post types (e.g., carousel, reels, static images) as input.
        Queries the dataset in Astra DB to calculate average engagement metrics for each post type.

    Provide Insights: Use GPT integration in Langflow to generate simple insights based on the data
        Example outputs:
            Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts.
            Reels drive 2x more comments compared to other formats.


Submission requirement:

    -Create your project, link it to level supermind hackathon
    -Record a video describing:
        --Langflow workflow
        --How DataStax was used to store and query data
        --How GPT was leveraged to generate insights
    -Add the link to your Github repository or Google Drive link of the ZIP file containing your code.
    -Add the YouTube video link.
    -Demo videos are a must.
    -The video shouldn't be private.
    -A well-written description is a plus.
    -The project repository must be public.
